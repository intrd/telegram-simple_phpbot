## Usage.. sample.php

*TL;DR*: The sample.php file will check every 5s if someone is mentioning the bot @username or talking him in pvt. It process and reply to this chatID based on his message w/ some custom triggers.

### Ten steps to setup your bot..
1. Open Telegram, talk w/ the `http://telegram.me/BotFather` and setup a new Telegram Bot and take a note of your BotID:Botkey, something like: `234015785:AAEsvIjg0AcWOINXR0Xt-TGLamuz9k8f10Y`
2. Edit sample.php and set your $botkey, enable $debug=true too.
3. Search on Telegram for yoour bot @username and start a conversation.. 
4. Now run `php sample.php`, discover what is your chatID and edit $debug_chatid at sample.php.. all your bot activity will be forwarded to this opened chat, for debbugin purpose.
5. Test if your botid, chatid and ap√≠key is ok doing a GET request browsing to your bot URL: `https://api.telegram.org/bot<botid>:<botkey>/sendmessage?chat_id=<chatid>&text=hello%20world!` in my sample `https://api.telegram.org/bot234015785:AAEsvIjg0AcWOINXR0Xt-TGLamuz9k8f10Y/sendmessage?chat_id=65628842&text=hello%20world!`, if the bot says Hello Word! to you, its ok. (PS: group chats use negative chatIDs, -<chatid>)
```
Http valid response..
{"ok":true,"result":{"message_id":4,"from":{"id":234015785,"first_name":"intrdtest","username":"intrd_bot"},"chat":{"id":2722434,"first_name":"intrd","username":"intrd","type":"private"},"date":1462316228,"text":"hello world!"}}
```
6. Change the $trigger_botname to your bot @username or something you want to trigger your bot replies on groups.  
7. To check if someone is talking w/ your bot every 5 seconds use my `./run.sh` bash daemon, or `watch -n5 php sample.php` or setup a cronjob
9. Now put him on a group.. test if your bot is replying when you mention his $trigger_botname, ask him about "day of week", say him some of $bads, customize reply_get() function.
